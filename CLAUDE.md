# CLAUDE.md - STAC DEM BC Project Guidelines

## Project Overview: Automated Weekly STAC DEM BC Updates

This project implements automated weekly updates of STAC DEM BC JSONs using VM-based cron automation with incremental change detection. The implementation adopts proven performance improvements from stac_orthophoto_bc (parallel processing, pre-validation) before building automation infrastructure.

**Architecture:** VM-based cron → Change detection → Parallel validation/processing → S3 sync → PgSTAC registration

**Expected Performance:**
- First run (full): ~1-1.5 hours (down from 5-6 hours)
- Weekly runs (incremental): 5-15 minutes for typical 10-50 new files
- Cost: $0 additional (uses existing VM)

### Key Implementation Phases

**Phase 1-2: Modernization ✅ COMPLETE (phase1-2-modernization worktree)**
- Port stac_orthophoto_bc performance improvements
- Pre-validation system with COG detection
- Parallel item creation using ThreadPoolExecutor
- Incremental update logic with change detection
- Optimize spatial extent calculation
- **Result:** 100-item test passed, ready for VM automation

**Phase 3: VM Automation (phase3-automation worktree - future)**
- Master automation script (stac_update_weekly.sh)
- Cron configuration on stac-prod VM
- Benchmarking and monitoring system
- Logging infrastructure

### Project Context

**Dataset:** 58,109 DEM GeoTIFFs from BC provincial objectstore (nrs.objectstore.gov.bc.ca/gdwuts)
- Grew 158% from initial 22,548 files (discovered in Phase 2.1 change detection)
- ~90 files with parentheses in filename excluded (all fail validation - see issue #8)

**Actual Performance (Feb 2026 - Full Build):**
- 58,028 items created in ~5.5 hours (~6,450 items/hour)
- Validation caching working (cache fix applied)
- Parallel processing with 32 workers
- 99.86% success rate (81 items failed/missing)
- **Bottleneck:** Network I/O reading remote GeoTIFFs for metadata

**Current Status:**
- ✅ Incremental update capability (change detection working)
- ✅ Validation caching (GeoTIFF validation)
- ✅ STAC JSON validation layer (new)
- ⏳ Manual execution (automation planned - Phase 3)
- ✅ Spatial extent optimized (hardcoded BC bbox)

**Goals:**
1. ~~Reduce full processing time to ~1-1.5 hours~~ → **Reality: 5-6 hours** (network I/O limited)
2. Enable weekly/monthly incremental updates (likely 30-60 min for 50-100 new files)
3. ✅ Implement robust validation and error handling
4. ⏳ Automate via VM cron jobs (Phase 3)
5. ✅ Maintain audit trail and benchmarking

**Key Learning:** Performance is network I/O bound, not CPU bound. Future optimization: local metadata caching (Issue #10).

### Data Tracking & Validation System

**File-based tracking for quality assurance and incremental updates:**

```
data/
├── urls_list.txt              # Master URL list from BC objectstore (58,109 URLs)
├── urls_new.txt               # New URLs detected by change detection
├── urls_deleted.txt           # Deleted URLs (audit trail)
├── stac_geotiff_checks.csv    # Source validation (url, is_geotiff, is_cog)
└── stac_item_validation.csv   # Output validation (item_id, json_valid, error)
```

**Validation layers:**
1. **GeoTIFF validation** (`stac_geotiff_checks.csv`) - Validates source data quality
   - Checks if URL is readable GeoTIFF
   - Detects Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFF status
   - Caches results to avoid re-validation
   - Used during item creation to skip invalid sources

2. **STAC JSON validation** (`stac_item_validation.csv`) - Validates output data quality
   - Checks generated STAC item JSONs are valid
   - Uses pystac for spec compliance
   - Tracks validation errors for debugging
   - Filters items before PgSTAC registration
   - Script: `scripts/validate_stac_items.py`

**Workflow integration:**
```
Source URLs → GeoTIFF Validation → Item Creation → JSON Validation → Registration
 (urls_list)   (geotiff_checks)      (.qmd/.py)    (item_validation)   (pgstac)
```

**Key insight:** Separation of source quality (can we read it?) from output quality (is STAC valid?) enables better debugging and incremental processing.

### Script Evolution: .qmd → .py

**Current state:**
- `.qmd` files: Good for exploration, mixed R/Python workflows
- `.py` scripts: Better for production, automation, testing

**Migration strategy (Issue #7):**
- New scripts: Write as pure Python (`.py`)
- Existing `.qmd`: Migrate gradually to standalone scripts
- Keep `.qmd`: For documentation/examples if useful

**Benefits of .py for production:**
- Better IDE support and debugging
- Easier testing and CI/CD integration
- Cleaner for cron/automation
- Standard Python packaging and distribution
- No R dependency for core workflows

## Behavioral Guidelines

These guidelines reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.

Before implementing:

- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.

When editing existing code:

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:

- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

**The test:** Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:

1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.

## Project-Specific Notes

### Testing Strategy
- Use `test_only = True` and `test_number_items = 10` for development
- Test in worktrees before merging to main
- Validate with dev S3 bucket and PgSTAC instance
- Benchmark timing at each phase
- Verify STAC API queries through images.a11s.one

**IMPORTANT: Always run tests and production with logging enabled:**
```bash
# Test run with logging
quarto render stac_create_item.qmd --execute 2>&1 | tee logs/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_test_phase1_10items.log

# Production run with logging
quarto render stac_create_item.qmd --execute 2>&1 | tee logs/$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)_prod_full_run.log
```
Logs capture: configuration, validation progress, item creation, errors, warnings, timing, and summary statistics.

### Key Trade-offs Documented in Issues
- **Spatial extent:** Hardcoded BC bbox vs calculated (saves ~20 minutes, BC boundary stable)
- **Validation caching:** Pre-validate all files vs validate on-demand (frontload cost, faster iterations)
- **Parallel processing:** ThreadPoolExecutor vs multiprocessing (avoid rasterio threading issues)

### Parallel Processing & Performance Patterns

**Proven from Phase 1-2 (stac_orthophoto_bc + stac_dem_bc):**

**1. ThreadPoolExecutor for Rasterio Operations**
```python
# CORRECT: Works reliably with rasterio
with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
    results = list(executor.map(process_geotiff, urls))

# WRONG: Causes threading conflicts, hangs/crashes
with multiprocessing.Pool() as pool:
    results = pool.map(process_geotiff, urls)
```
WHY: Rasterio uses internal threading that conflicts with multiprocessing. ThreadPoolExecutor avoids these conflicts while still providing parallelism for I/O-bound operations (reading remote GeoTIFFs via /vsicurl/).

**2. Validation Caching Strategy**
- Pre-validate all files in parallel using `rio cogeo validate`
- Cache results in CSV (`url, is_geotiff, is_cog`)
- Skip unreadable files during item creation (logged, not fatal)
- Incremental mode: only validate new URLs not in cache
- **Benefit:** Frontload ~20-30 min cost once, skip 100-500 invalid files on every subsequent run

**3. Test Mode Design Pattern**
When implementing test modes that support both clean runs and incremental appends:
```python
if test_only and not incremental:
    # Clear BOTH metadata AND files
    collection.links = [link for link in collection.links if link.rel != 'item']
    for old_json in glob.glob(f"{path_local}/*-*.json"):
        os.remove(old_json)
```
WHY: Clearing only collection links leaves orphaned JSON files across test runs. Must clean both to prevent accumulation and mismatches.

**4. Incremental Mode Duplicate Prevention**
```python
existing_item_hrefs = {link.target for link in collection.links if link.rel == 'item'}
for result in results:
    item_href = f"{path_s3_stac}/{result['id']}.json"
    if item_href not in existing_item_hrefs:
        collection.add_link(Link(...))
```
WHY: Reprocessing same URLs (e.g., after failures, testing) would create duplicate links without explicit checking. PySTAC doesn't prevent duplicates automatically.

**5. Dataset Monitoring**
- BC DEM objectstore grew 158% undocumented (22,548 → 58,109 files)
- Change detection discovered 35,569 new files, 8 deleted
- **Lesson:** Always implement monitoring/change detection for external data sources, even if "stable"

### Dependencies
- Python: pystac, rio_stac, rasterio, rio-cogeo, pandas, tqdm, concurrent.futures (built-in)
- System: rio CLI tools (rasterio[cogeo])
- Infrastructure: DigitalOcean VM (stac-prod), S3 (stac-dem-bc), PgSTAC

### Infrastructure Management

**Current State (Phase 1-3):**
- VM deployment: Manual via `vm_upload_run()` function from stac_uav_bc
- S3 management: AWS CLI commands
- Server provisioning: Scripts similar to stac_uav_bc setup

**Future Migration (Post-Phase 3):**
- **awshak repository:** `/Users/airvine/Projects/repo/awshak`
- OpenTofu/Terraform-based infrastructure management
- S3 buckets already IaC-managed: `stac-dem-bc` (prod), can easily create `dev-stac-dem-bc` for testing
- Other managed buckets: imagery-uav-bc, stac-orthophoto-bc, water-temp-bc, backup-imagery-uav
- Features: versioning, lifecycle policies, CORS, public access controls
- Reproducible, version-controlled server setups (future)

**Note:** Phase 3 VM automation uses current manual deployment approach. S3 buckets already IaC-managed. Future phases should migrate VM provisioning to awshak for full reproducibility.
